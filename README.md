# Challenge 2 : Portfolio

For this challenge the task is to build your starter page for your professional portfolio. 

The importance of having a professional portfolio:
* Shows your skill set and what you can build on your own.
* Shows off your personality to clients and potential employers to see if you're a good fit for the company's culture.
* Have a page you can keep tabs where you can see where you stand in the professional world. If there is any skills you want to pick up, any projects you want to go back and improve, and can inspire your next project if you havent done that idea yet. 

What I learnt:
* When coding, take it step by step. its easier to gather your thoughts together when you're doing one thing at a time.
* When on a time crunch, time management takes the upmost importance!
* I should really look up good color combinations cause when I was deciding colors, it was hard to find colors that fit together and still makes the content on the page look visible.

I will return to this project as I move through the course so I can keep updating things as I get them into my head. I am still learning and although I can hardly keep up with everything, I'm going to get better and better!
